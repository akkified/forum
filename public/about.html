          Our main tool was Visual Studio Code, which we used to actually code our website. We also used 
          Cloud Console as well as Google Developer Tools. We embedded a forum from Powr, and also have a Google API for 
          Login with Google.

          <span>In our design process, we faced countless adverse challenges and issues :</span>
          <li>Our Login with Google button did not work properly</li>
          <li>Our Backgrounds used to interfere with the content</li>
          <li>We could not find a good forum, so we used comments</li>
          <li>While trivial, our backgrounds were hard to find</li>

          Becuse our project is all virtual, all of our steps consited of some form of device. 
          We started off with the idea. Rik wanted to make students better teachers, 
          but at the same time, help students learn faster. He came up with the idea of 
          making a forum. The first version of our forum was functional. It worked, 
          but it was ugly. We had a design with 2 components: the header and the body. Our next
          phase was to add design. We started with redoing all of our layout. Instead of having 2 blocks,
          we have one big chunk that has all of our content. This keeps it organized, and lets us 
          prioritize other aspects of our development. After creating a design, we added our content onto this. This was harder than expected. 
          We had to go through many lines of ode to find the error. With that solved, we had to add a login button. 
          Our process was always creating something new, and then getting criticism and new ideas. 
          This is how we keep improving out forum.
